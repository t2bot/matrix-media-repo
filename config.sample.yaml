#
# This will also cache errors from the homeserver.

# Plugins are optional pieces of the media repo used to extend the functionality offered.
# Currently there are only antispam plugins, but in future there should be more options.
# Plugins are not supported on per-domain paths and are instead repo-wide. For more
# information on writing plugins, please visit #matrix-media-repo:t2bot.io on Matrix.
#
# Note: Using plugins will mean that your media repo's memory usage will be higher because
# uploads are cached in-memory temporarily.
